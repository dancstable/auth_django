# Microservice Overview and Instructions

A microservices architecture offers several advantages over monolithic applications. Under this design the overall application is broken up by distinct services. In this way mMicroservices allow for:
- Scaling each microservice differently, such as search, payments, data science, etc.
- Separation of concerns
- Each team can work independently on their domain
- Mix of technologies - e.g., each service can independently use django, flask, fastapi, etc.

# Microservice Architecture

An authentication layer is needed for authentication, authorization, and provides identity access management.

Microservices authenticate users by tokens via an authentication layer. When a user logs in, the auth layer generates a signed token and returns it to the client. 

![auth flow](./docs/flow.png "Auth Flow")

For every service that the client seeks to access, the microservice verifies the signature of the JWT token by using the same secret provided to sign the token. This verification is automatically done by Auth0, such that the secret key does not have to be distributed to every microservice.

# Install
To run the auth0 framework, make sure you have `python3` and `pip` installed.

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and populate it with the client ID, domain, secret, callback URL and audience for your Auth0 app. 

Once those variables are set:

1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies and run `python server.py`.
The app will be served at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
2. Run `python3 manage.py migrate` to migrate the database schema
3. Run `python3 manage.py runserver 3000` to run the server.

The app will be served at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

# Running the App with Docker

To run the sample, make sure you have `docker` installed.

To run the sample with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), make sure you have `docker` installed.

Rename the .env.example file to .env, change the environment variables, and register the URLs as explained [previously](#running-the-app).

Run `sh exec.sh` to build and run the docker image in Linux or run `.\exec.ps1` to build
and run the docker image on Windows.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders),
either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**,or
enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://auth0.com/docs/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/jwt) to call your APIs and
**flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules).
